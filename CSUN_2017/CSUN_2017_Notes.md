# CSUN 2017 Talk Snippet - Accessibility in an Agile World with the Adobe Livefyre Team
## The hunt
Amy was introduced to the Livefyre public-facing widgets or "apps". She gave them an initial a11y review and reported their issues to us.
## Taking responsibility
Having an expressed interest sharpening my a11y skills, I became an advocate within my team. My goal was to fix all the issues identified by the a11y team & continue to promote berst practices with new development.
## The task at hand
I took the job of turning Amy's report into actionable JIRA tickets for our Agile process & immediattely started making mistakes.
### Mistake #1
#### What I did
I read Amy's report & began making immediate plans to remedy the issues myself.
#### Why it was wrong
I was getting ahead of myself & preparing to circumvent the Agile process. My work time would not have been accounted for & might have bumped higher priority items off the dockette.
#### What I should have done
Created tickets to then be delegated by the product team.
### Mistake #2
#### What I did
I made the tickets by essentially copying line items from Amy's report.
#### Why it was wrong
I assumed that the tickets would be assigned back to me. I left them vague because the details of the work were already logged in my brain.
#### What I should have done
I should have translated the issues into actions that could have been carried-out by another engineer & expected results that could be verified by our local quality assurance team.
### Mistake #3
#### What I did
I rephrased the tickets from describing our failures to describing ideal behavior experiences.
#### Why it was wrong
Not everyone on my engineering or quality team is well versed in modern a11y techniques & best practices. Not everyone is confident executing on or testing a11y fixes.
#### What I should have done
Provide explicit details in the tickets of what code changes to make w/ reference links & describe how to test that the fixes are in place & positively affect the final user experience.
## In the end
I updated the tickets with HTML snippets, containing the attributes that I expect to be used and on which elements I expect them to be used. I also made sure to include expected behavior details so that the assigned engineer and quality engineer can test the experience & not just the rendered HTML. Another engineer was assigned the tickets over time while I was assigned non-a11y work. That engineer executed on the tickets while occasionally tapping me as a subject matter expert to resolve some issues that I didn't foresee when writing the tickets. The quality assurance team was then able to test these fixes with confidence.
## The take-away
- Engineering tickets aren't for describing problems; they're for detailing solutions
- Have an a11y ambassador on the engineering team who works with stakeholders to write detailed, solution-oriented tickets
