Recognizing a scam before opening the message.

# Who's it from?
The `from` line of your email should be the first place you look when you're trying to catch a scammer.

# Friends & family
Very Risky | Less Risky
-----------|------------------
People you haven't spoken with in a long time. | People you regularly message.

Personal email accounts get hacked. Those hackers will then use thier victim's accounts to send out scam emails to everyone of the victim's contact lists. Don't be the next victim.
If you get an email from someone you haven't heard from in a while, or someone you regularly speak with but rarely email, then they might have been hacked by a scammer who wants to get you next.
