Recognizing a scam before opening the message.

# Who's it from?
The `from` line of your email should be the first place you look when you're trying to catch a scammer.

# Friends & family
Very Risky | Less Risky
-----------|-----------
People you haven't spoken with in a long time. | People you regularly message.

Personal email accounts and contact lists get hacked. Those hackers then send out scam emails to everyone their victim knows.
Don't be the next victim!
If you get an email from someone you haven't heard from in a long time, or maybe someone you regularly speak to but *rarely* by email, then they might have been hacked by a scammer who wants to get you next! You'll want to investigate further and proceed with caution.
Even people who regularly email you could have fallen victim to a hacker, so be cautious if anything seems out of the ordinary, such as an unusual subject line or an attachment.
