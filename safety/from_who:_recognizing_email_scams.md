# Who's it from?
The `from` line of your email should be the first place you look when you're trying to catch a scammer.

# Friends & family
Very Risky | Less Risky

People you haven't spoken with in a long time. | People you regularly message.

Personal email accounts and contact lists get hacked. Those hackers then send out scam emails to everyone their victim knows.
Don't be the next victim!
