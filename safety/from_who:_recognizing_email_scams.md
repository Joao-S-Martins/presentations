Recognizing a scam before opening the message.

# Who's it from?
The `from` line of your email should be the first place you look when you're trying to catch a scammer.

# Friends & family
Very Risky | Less Risky
-----------|-----------
People you haven't spoken with in a long time. | People you regularly message.

???
Personal email accounts and contact lists get hacked. Those hackers then send out scam emails to everyone their victim knows.
Don't be the next victim!
If you get an email from someone you haven't heard from in a long time, or maybe someone you regularly speak to but *rarely* by email, then they might have been hacked by a scammer who wants to get you next! You'll want to investigate further and proceed with caution.
Even people who regularly email you could have fallen victim to a hacker, so be cautious if anything seems out of the ordinary, such as an unusual subject line or an email attachment.

# Government agencies
Very Risky | Less Risky
-----------|-----------
All of them. | Messages from specific employees at an agency that you have recently contacted.

???
Scammers often pretent to be from large government agencies with familiar names, like the FBI, CIA, IRS, and the VA or DMV. These agencies don't typically use email to contact you. Government agencies still rely on **paper mail**, or knocking on your door, when they need something from you. They sometimes send confirmation emails or reminder emails, but only *after* you've done some *recent* business with them.
Sometimes scammers pretend to be from a local agency, such as your county Sheriff's office or a property tax collector. But when they do this, they often call themselves the "County Sheriff" or "County Tax Collector". Every **real** email I've seen from a county agency makes sure to say *which* county. Scammers don't usually know which county you live in, which gives you an upper hand.

# Banks & creditors
Very Risky | Less Risky
-----------|-----------
Banks and creditors that you haven't done new business with in the past year. | Banks that you use every month.

While most scammers try to sneak programs onto your computer or trick yome scammers go straight for your wallet
