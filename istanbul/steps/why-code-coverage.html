<h2>Why Code Coverage?</h2>

<blockquote>...But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don't know we don't know.</blockquote>

    You never know how the next engineer is going to perceive your code.
    Method name might be misleading, causing them to be misused later.
    Misusing a method may lead to re-writing a method to fit a new purpose.
    Suddenly, the method doesn't satisfy its original purpose and people look to you to fix it.
    This all happens because parts of the method were left untested and there wasn't a red flag...
    We've unknowingly stepped into unknow territory.
