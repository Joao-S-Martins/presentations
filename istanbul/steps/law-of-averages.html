        <li>
            Set-up Istanbul on a JS repo
        </li>
        <li>
            Run it to get a baseline coverage reading
        </li>
        <li>
            Use that reading to set a Git hook on push requests
        </li>
        <li>
            Encourage engineers to exceed the threshold, even if just by a little
        </li>
    </ol>

<div class="notes">
    We can raise the threshold as the baseline coverage gradualy rises, encouraging a higher standard of coding and testing over time.
