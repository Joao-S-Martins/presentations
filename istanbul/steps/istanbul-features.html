        <li>
            It parses and understands every bit of JavaScript, which is fairly 
            unique among code-coverage tools.
        </li>
        <li>
            Many tools take a function-level approach to analyzation, but
            Istanbul digs deeper.
        </li>
        <li>Charting and linking lets you drill down to exactly which lines
            aren't covered and bestowes the appropriate amount of shame upon
            you. The results of a coverage are actually written into a
            cross-platform compatible JSON file and can be rendered in outher
            visualization tools.
        </li>
        <li>The "coverage" metric can be used as a threshold for git hooks that
            will prevent an engineer from pushing code that doesn't meet a
            minimum amount of test coverage.
        </li>
